This work proposes, implements and evaluates a control algorithm for safe road crossing with a mobile robot. The algorithm is based on a behavior tree architecture and takes into consideration the positions of vehicles in the robot's surroundings. The robot uses the detected vehicles to decide when it is safe to cross the road. The algorithm is implemented in a simulation environment and evaluated on a real robot. The results show that the robot is able to cross the road safely in most cases.
