## Course description

The course will teach deep learning methods for well-known robotic problems, such as semantic segmentation or reactive robot motion control. The overall goal is timeless universal knowledge rather than an enumeration of all known deep learning architectures. Students are assumed to have prior knowledge of mathematics (gradient, jacobian, hessian, gradient descend, Taylor polynomial) and machine learning (Bayesian risk minimization, linear classifier). The labs are divided into two parts, in the first part students will solve basic deep ML problems from scratch (including reimplementing autograd backpropagation), in the second part students will build on existing templates to solve complex problems including RL, transformers and generative networks.

All relevant information is available on courseware [here](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b3b33urob/start).
