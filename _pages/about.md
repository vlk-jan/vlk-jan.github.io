I am a student of cybernetics and robotics at FEE CTU. I'm interested in the fields of autonomous control of mobile agents and computer vision.

I am currently working on my masters thesis in the field of autonomous driving. Specifically processing of LiDAR data and its further use in the field of object detection and tracking. I am cooperating with the company Valeo on this project.
