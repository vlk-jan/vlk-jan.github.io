  * I have worked on multiple projects within the CTU VRAS (vision for robotics and autonomous systems) group.
  * These projects included developing software for autonomous mobile robots, as well as integration on the hardware side.

## Experience

* Porsche Engineering Student Contest 2022
  * 2nd place
  * The goal was to develop software for autonomous car model and compete against other teams in terms of speed and accuracy. The task was to do laps in a circuit marked by black tape and detect road signs and obstacles

* Duke of Edinburgh International Award
  * I achieved all three possible levels – Bronze, Silver and Gold. The highest one in 2018.

* Education course ASURO, 2017
  * In this course we were given education kits ASURO, and our task was to construct it and implement different actions ranging from line following to detection of obstacles.

* Robosoutěž 2016
  * 1st place
  * The task was a path-finding robot, it was supposed to follow a black line into a maze, find its way through the maze get on another black line and follow it back to the beginning as fast as possible.
